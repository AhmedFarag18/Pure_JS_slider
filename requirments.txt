I want to use ONLY Flexbox, CSS, and Jquery/JavaScript.
I do NOT want to use any plug-ins-SLICK or SWIPPER.js

I have 10 pictures with captions and a picture number.

The HEIGHT of all the images are the same(the widths are not). Do not want to skew images.  Height should be 100%.
img src="https://picsum.photos/300/400?random=1"
img src="https://picsum.photos/600/400?random=2"

The Thumbnails can be set as squares and those can be skewed(cover)
flex-wrap: wrap; probably space between or center
img src="https://picsum.photos/75/75?random=1" or you can use the above image and have the browser size it to 75x75(preferred)

The full image will be something like img src="https://picsum.photos/600/1200?random=1"  This page (open new tab) can just scale the image(without skewing to 80vh or 80vw with a close button.

The picture number can be found within the HTML code
The caption can also be found within the HTML code
The link to the full image can be found within the HTML code

Thus each set will be a set of three images--Thumbnail, Image, and the full Image.

What I want is when you click on one of the thumbnails, I want to have the placeholder animate and  show the Image new image.  When a user click on the link within the caption then the Full Image will be shown within a new tab with a close button.

This should be done with CSS, Jquery/JavaScript!!!

The only plug-in I want are:
1) https://animate.style/   (animations) for use within animations
2) font Awesome for use with icons
3) jquery if that is what you use.

See layout attached sliderFlex.jpg

Bonus-Without using a Slider Plug-In if you can figure a way to use jquery or javascript to put next/previous button that would make me really happy.  But again, I do not want to use a plugin-ie slick, swiper.js, etc to do this.  You would need to build it into your js script file.
